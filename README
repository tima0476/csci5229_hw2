OpenGL Lorenz Attractor - HW2 for CSCI 5229 - University of Colorado Boulder

Time Taken:  13.5 hours

This program displays the first 50,000 points of a Lorenz attractor in 3D space, starting from coordinate 
(1,1,1).  

Coloring:  Line segments in the attractor representation are colored according to a "heatmap" which indicates
velocity.  The shortest line segments (representing the slowest instantaneous velocity) are colored blue.
Colors then increase by wavelength all the way to red which indicates the longest (fastest) segments.

Animation:  The display of the attractor is animated at a target framerate of 62.5 FPS (period of 16 msec).  With
vsync enabled on a 60Hz display, this should result in an actual framerate of 60 FPS.  On a system without vsync
enabled, the actual animation speed will be approx 62.5 FPS, which will cause the animations to run slightly 
faster than indicated.  On startup, axis rotation is animated with a default rotation rate of Azimuth +30 degrees 
per second, and Elevation +15 degrees per second.

The attractor parameters Sigma, Beta, and Rho can also be animated, but they are initially static (zero default 
velocity).

The Axis rotations and attractor parameters can also be manually incremented or decremented using keypresses,
as shown below:
